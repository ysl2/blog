## Install lua5.1 on MacOS

> Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73586208/can-you-install-disabled-homebrew-packages

By default homebrew-core is not tapped anymore. This is needed for brew edit to work though. Thus this small addition to the other answers.

Tap homebrew-core:

```bash
brew tap homebrew/core --force
```

Edit the formula with:

```bash
brew edit lua@5.1
```

Remove the line:

```text
disable! date: "2022-07-31", because: :unmaintained
```

And install it with:

```bash
HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1 brew install lua@5.1
```

If you donâ€™t plan to edit more packages, untap and free the space from tap again (~1Gb):

```bash
brew untap homebrew/core
```
