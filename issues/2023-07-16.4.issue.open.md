## 1. Don't bypass display manager

I have added desktop file into my fork dwm `ysl2/dwm`, so no need to manually add it. It will be auto added when compiling my dwm.

e.g, dwm

```bash
sudo vim /usr/share/xsessions/dwm.desktop

# Ref: https://github.com/elken/dwm/blob/master/dwm.desktop
```

```text
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=DWM
Comment=Dynamic window manager
Exec=/home/elken/.dwm/bin/start.sh
Icon=dwm
Type=XSession
```

## 2. Bypass display manager using startx

1. Add exec startx in ~/.profile (I have already added in dotlib)
2. Add the exec de/wm into ~/.xinitrc (I have aleady added in dotfiles deepin branch)
3. Disable lightdm `sudo systemctl disable lightdm`

BUG:

When bypassing lightdm:
If using dde, behaves like above, and specifically the google-chrome cannot be opened, it reports gtk theme is none.
