Download `genymotion` from official website.

Install it, but without sudo (install under `/home` as normal user)

Create a new virtual android phone, but it's android version should below 9.0

Download https://github.com/m9rco/Genymotion_ARM_Translation zip file that fit for the virtual machine's android version, then drag drop into virtual machine

Reboot

Install apps by drag drop, finish.
