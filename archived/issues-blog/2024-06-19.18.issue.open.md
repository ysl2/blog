# [\#18 Issue](https://github.com/ysl2/blog/issues/18) `open`: Linux file descriptor and redirection

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39717545?u=3a56d7b47e1688f70c83e440ba0835f8d24c43e3&v=4" width="50">[ysl2](https://github.com/ysl2) opened issue at [2024-06-19 15:14](https://github.com/ysl2/blog/issues/18):

Create a new file descriptor

```
touch temp.txt
# Create a new file descriptor 3
#  The created file descriptor only available in current shell session, associated with process number.
exec 3> temp.txt
# Check this descriptor, method 1
# `$$` means get the current session's process number.
sudo ls -l /proc/$$/fd/3
# Check this descriptor, method 2
sudo lsof -p $$ | grep ' 3w '
# Then, you can use this new file descriptor to redirect stdin, stdout and stderr as normal.
# Usually, the self-created descriptor's name between 3 and 9.
```

Temp file descriptor

```
# Save `ls` command's output to a temp file descriptor and echo this descriptor's path:
‚ùØ echo <(ls)
/proc/self/fd/11

# For example:
# Save `ls` command's output to a temp file descriptor and return this descriptor by `<(ls)`, 
# and use this descriptor as the `tee` command's stdin by `<`, 
# then stdout the content to `temp.txt` by `tee` command
tee temp.txt < <(ls)
# This is like:
ls | tee temp.txt
```

Case

```
# This below is error
# That's beacuse the `>` is created before sudo, and sudo only works on `ls`, not works on `>`,
# and due to we don't have the enough permission for `/etc` folder when creating `>`, so it complains error.
sudo ls > /etc/temp.txt  # Output error

# These below is correct
sudo ls | sudo tee /etc/temp.txt
# Or
sudo sh -c 'ls > /etc/temp.txt'
```
