## 中间人攻击，known_hosts被修改，解决方法：

The warning message you're seeing indicates that the SSH host key for the remote server has changed since the last time you connected. This could be due to legitimate reasons (like a server reinstallation) or potentially a security risk (like a man-in-the-middle attack).

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Verify the Change**:
   - Contact the system administrator or the owner of the remote server to confirm whether the host key change is expected.

2. **Remove the Old Key**:
   - If the change is legitimate, you can remove the offending key from your `known_hosts` file. Use the following command:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -R [10.0.224.7]:36000
     ```

3. **Reconnect**:
   - Try connecting again. You should be prompted to accept the new host key:
     ```bash
     ssh user@10.0.224.7 -p 36000
     ```

4. **Manually Edit `known_hosts`** (if necessary):
   - Open the `known_hosts` file in a text editor:
     ```bash
     nano /root/.ssh/known_hosts
     ```
   - Locate and remove the line corresponding to the offending key (line 54 in your case).

5. **Add the New Key**:
   - After confirming the new key, you can add it by reconnecting, as mentioned above.

### Important Note:
Always ensure that you verify the authenticity of the new host key before proceeding to avoid potential security risks.
